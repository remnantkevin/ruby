1-to-many
=========
user ----(owns)---->* bleat

many-to-many
============
user <----(tagged in > || < tag)---->* bleat


if use user.bleats, it can't know if you're talking about those bleats it owns or those bleats that tag it

therefore, can't have a one2many and m2m relationship between same models, at same time
